	<h1>Delta</h1>
	<p>
	Type: Card<br>
	Players: 1<br>
	Mathematically optimize pairs of cards to balance your score and stay in the safe zone.<br>
	</p>

	<h3>Setup</h3>
	<p>
	Remove jacks from a standard 52 card deck and shuffle.<br>
	Place one card face up; this forms the operation pile.<br>
	</p>

	<h3>Play</h3>
	<p>
	Place three cards face up in a row below the operation pile.<br>
	Draw four cards into your hand.<br>
	You will pair the cards in your hand with the placed cards so that your score stays between 1 and 24 (inclusive), over seven rounds.<br>
	The card's face determines its value, where A = 1, Q = 11, and K = 12.<br>
	</p>

	<p>
	The laid out card of a pair is referred to as the alpha, and the card from your hand as the beta.<br>
	If the alpha and the beta are opposite colors, the value of the beta is changed to its mirror value.<br>
	To find this, subtract it from 13.<br>
	For example: 3 becomes 10, 9 becomes 4, 6 becomes 7.<br>
	The absolute difference between the pair's values is then calculated.<br>
	For example: αA♣ and βQ♠ make 10, α7♦ and β8♣ make 2.<br>
	The sum of all of the pairs' differences is your score for that round.<br>
	</p>

	<p>
	The fourth card remaining in your hand is placed in the operation pile.<br>
	If this card's color matches the previous top card, the current round's operation is addition.<br>
	Otherwise, it is subtraction.<br>
	Once you have decided on your pairs and operation, modify your total score accordingly.<br>
	For the first round, the operation is addition.<br>
	For the last round, the operation is subtraction.<br>
	Discard the pairs, then place and draw cards as before.<br>
	</p>

	<p>
	If your score at the end of a round is less than 1 or greater than 24, the game is lost.<br>
	If you complete the seventh round in the safe zone, the game is won.<br>
