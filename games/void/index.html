	Type: Card<br>
	Players: 1+<br>
	Mathematically optimize pairs of cards.<br>
	<b>This one looks half-assed because I created it and then decided it wasn't interesting enough.</b><br>
	I may attempt to enhance it later on.<br>
	</p>

	<h3>Setup</h3>
	<p>
	Remove jacks from a standard 52 card deck and shuffle.<br>
	Place four cards face up in a row.<br>
	Draw four cards into your hand.<br>
	To change the difficulty, increase or decrease the number of cards placed and drawn.<br>
	</p>

	<h3>Play</h3>
	<p>
	You will pair the cards in your hand with the laid out ones in a way that will give you the lowest score.<br>
	The card's face determines its value, where aces are ones, queens are elevens, and kings are twelves.<br>
	The laid out card of a pair is referred to as the alpha, and the card from your hand as the beta.<br>
	</p>

	<p>
	If the alpha and the beta are opposite colors, the value of the beta is changed to its mirror value.<br>
	To find this, subtract it from 13.<br>
	For example: 3 becomes 10, 9 becomes 4, 6 becomes 7.<br>
	The absolute difference between the pair's values is then calculated.<br>
	For example: alpha ace of clubs and beta 10 of spades makes 9, alpha 7 of diamonds and beta 8 of clubs makes 2.<br>
	The sum of all of the pairs' differences is your score for that hand.<br>
	Once you have decided on a configuration, add to your total score.<br>
	Discard all cards, then place and draw four more cards.<br>
