    <h1>Conquest</h1>
    <ul class="stats">
      <li>Type: Card</li>
      <li>Players: 2</li>
      <li>Combines memory and strategy in a war to capture members of the royal court.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Setup</h2>
    <p>Requires a standard deck of playing cards, with Jokers, nines, and tens removed.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Collect the court cards (Jacks, Queens, Kings), shuffle, and then split into two even piles face down.</li>
      <li>
        Take the remaining number cards (A through 8), shuffle, and then split into two even piles face down. Make sure
        to keep your numeral deck and court deck separate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Leave room for an initially empty discard pile for each of the four piles you just made. You will also need a
        space to use for the capture pile, when you successfully capture an opponent's court member.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Deal</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Each player draws one card from the court pile, looks at it if they wish, and then places it face down in front
        of them.
      </li>
      <li>
        Next, five cards are drawn from the numeral pile. The numerals are knights, which are placed in a row, face
        down. This row represents the "Royal Guard".
      </li>
      <li>
        A recommended layout would be to place the court member near you, and then the five knights between the court
        member and your opponent, so that they appear to be guarding the court member.
      </li>
      <li>All of these cards may be looked at by their owner at any time, but cannot be rearranged.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Play</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The round begins by both players choosing and revealing one of their own knights for a few seconds.</li>
      <li>
        Players take turns selecting one of their knights to attack, and then selecting one of their opponent's knights
        as the target.
      </li>
      <li>Both knights are flipped face up and victory is determined (refer to the Fight section below).</li>
      <li>
        The knight that loses the fight is placed face up in the discard pile, and the winning knight returns to its
        owner's row of guards in the face down position.
      </li>
      <li>It is then the next player's turn.</li>
      <li>Discarded knights may be reshuffled as necessary.<br /></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Fight</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>When determining rank, Aces are the lowest 8s are the highest.</li>
      <li>If the attacking knight's rank is higher and the defending knight's suit is different, the attacker wins.</li>
      <li>If the knights are the same rank or suit, the defending player temporarily reveals their court member.</li>
      <li>If the court member and the attacking knight's suits match, the defender wins.</li>
      <li>
        Aces are martyrs; if an Ace attacks and loses the fight, the losing player draws a knight. This effect stacks
        with the double-loss effect (see the "Play" section about two consecutive losses above).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Win</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>If a player has one knight after losing two fights consecutively, they rally, and draw another knight.</li>
      <li>
        If a player has zero knights after a fight, they lose the round and must give their court member to their
        opponent, who places the card face up in their capture pile.
      </li>
      <li>
        Then, the winner discards their own court member, and each player draws a new one to start the next round.<br />
      </li>
      <li>The first player to capture three court members wins the game.</li>
    </ul>
