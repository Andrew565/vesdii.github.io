	Conquest is a 2-player memory game.<br>
	It is a <b>work in progress</b>.<br>
	Last updated: 12/07/2020<br>
	</p>

	<p>
	<b>Setup</b><br>
	Remove tens from a standard 52 card deck.<br>
	Collect court cards into a separate pile, then shuffle both piles.<br>
	There is an initially empty discard pile for each draw pile.<br>
	</p>

	<p>
	<b>Deal</b><br>
	Each player draws one card from the court pile, and five cards from the numeral pile.<br>
	The numerals are knights, and the court is the legacy.<br>
	Players place their knights in a row, face down.<br>
	The legacy is placed below the knights, face down.<br>
	These may be looked at by their owner at any time, but cannot be rearranged.<br>
	</p>

	<p>
	<b>Play</b><br>
	Every turn, a player chooses one of their knights to attack a chosen one of their opponent's knights.<br>
	Both knights are flipped and victory is determined (refer to the Fight section).<br>
	The knight that loses the fight is placed face up in the discard pile, and the winning knight returns to the face down position.<br>
	</p>

	<p>
	If a player has one knight after losing two fights in a row, they draw a knight and place it in their row.<br>
	If a player has zero knights after a fight, they lose the round and must give their legacy to their opponent, to be placed face up in their trophy pile.<br>
	Then, the winner discards their legacy and both players draw a new one.<br>
	</p>

	<p>
	<b>Fight</b><br>
	If the attacking knight's rank (A-9) is higher and the suit is different, the attacker wins.<br>
	If the knights are the same rank or suit, the defending player temporarily reveals their legacy.<br>
	If the legacy's color is not the color of the attacking knight, the defender wins.<br>
	If the defending knight is an ace and it loses a fight, [something cool happens...].<br>
	</p>

	<p>
	The game is won by obtaining the majority of trophies.<br>
	</p>
