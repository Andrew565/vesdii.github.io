	Conquest is a 2-player memory game.<br>
	It is a <b>work in progress</b>.
	</p>

	<p>
	<h3>Setup</h3>
	Remove nines and tens from a standard 52 card deck.<br>
	Collect court cards into a separate pile, then shuffle both piles.<br>
	There is an initially empty discard pile for each draw pile.
	</p>

	<p>
	<h3>Deal</h3>
	Each player draws one card from the court pile, and five cards from the numeral pile.<br>
	The numerals are knights, which are placed in a row, face down.<br>
	The court is placed below the knights, face down.<br>
	These may be looked at by their owner at any time, but cannot be rearranged.
	</p>

	<p>
	<h3>Play</h3>
	The round begins by both players revealing one of their own knights of choice for a few seconds.<br>
	Players take turns selecting one of their knights to attack a chosen one of their opponent's knights.<br>
	Both knights are flipped and victory is determined (refer to the Fight section).<br>
	The knight that loses the fight is placed face up in the discard pile, and the winning knight returns to the face down position.<br>
	It is then the next player's turn.
	</p>

	<p>
	If a player has one knight after losing two fights consecutively, they rally, drawing a knight.<br>
	If a player has zero knights after a fight, they lose the round and must give their court to their opponent, to be placed face up in their win pile.<br>
	Then, the winner discards their court and both players draw a new one.
	</p>

	<p>
	Discarded knights may be reshuffled as necessary.<br>
	The first player to win three courts wins the game.
	</p>

	<p>
	<h3>Fight</h3>
	If the attacking knight's rank (A low, 8 high) is higher and the suit is different, the attacker wins.<br>
	If the knights are the same rank or suit, the defending player temporarily reveals their court.<br>
	If the court and the attacking knight's suits match, the defender wins.<br>
	Aces are martyrs; if it attacks and loses the fight, the losing player draws a knight.<br>
	This effect stacks with the double-loss effect.
