	<p>
	Conquest is a 2-player competitive memory game.<br>
	It is a work in progress, so these rules may slightly change later.<br>
	</p>

	<p>
	- Setup<br>
	Remove aces, spade face cards, and diamond face cards from a standard 52 card deck.<br>
	Collect face cards into a separate pile, then shuffle both piles.<br>
	There is an initially empty discard pile for each draw pile.<br>
	One six sided die is needed.<br>
	</p>

	<p>
	- Deal<br>
	Each player draws one card from the face pile, and three cards from the numeral pile.<br>
	The numerals are knights, and the face is the legacy.<br>
	Players place their knights in a row, face down.<br>
	The legacy is placed below the knights, face down.<br>
	These may be looked at by their owner at any time, but cannot be rearranged.<br>
	</p>

	<p>
	- Play<br>
	Every turn, a player chooses one of their knights to attack a chosen one of their opponent's knights.<br>
	Both knights are flipped and victory is determined.<br>
	If the attacking knight's rank is higher and the suit is different, the attacker wins.<br>
	If the knights are the same rank or suit, the defending player temporarily reveals their legacy.<br>
	If the legacy's color is not the color of the attacking knight, the defender wins.<br>
	The knight that loses the conflict is placed face up in the discard pile, and the winning knight returns to where it was, face down again.<br>
	</p>

	<p>
	Between each turn, both players roll a die once.<br>
	If one player gets a higher roll and they have less than three knights, they draw a knight and add it to their row.<br>
	</p>

	<p>
	If a player has zero knights after a conflict, they lose the battle and must give their legacy to their opponent, to be placed face up in their trophy pile.<br>
	Then, the winner discards their legacy and both players draw a new one.<br>
	</p>

	<p>
	The game is won by having more trophies when the last legacy is discarded.<br>
	</p>
